# landing_page
A landing page created while going through the Odin Project curriculum 

Alright, so I was supposed to work on this project and like actually do commits and stuff but...I kind of didn't know how to get into my GitHub account until this morning.
So now it is just going to be me throwing the entire folder in here and making slight edits for certain things.
This will be the biggest mess of a repo on here so far.  I sincerely appologize to anyone who comes cross this somehow.
